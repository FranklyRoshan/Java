How is a reference variable different from a primitive variable? #

A reference variable stores the memory location of an object, while a primitive variable directly stores a value.

// Primitive variable stores the actual value 5
int i = 5; 

// Reference variable stores the memory location of the object
Animal dog = new Animal(12);
Primitive variables are stored in the stack memory.
Reference variables are stored in the stack, but the objects they refer to are stored in the heap memory.
What happens when you assign a reference variable to another?
When a reference variable is assigned to another, only the memory location (reference) is copied, not the actual object.
Example:
Animal cat = new Animal(15);
Animal nothing = cat; // Copies reference, not the object
Both cat and nothing now point to the same object in memory.
Since reference variables point to the same object, modifying the object through one reference affects all references pointing to it.
Example:
nothing.id = 10;

// Output: 10
System.out.println(cat.id);
Since nothing and cat refer to the same object, changing nothing.id also updates cat.id.
