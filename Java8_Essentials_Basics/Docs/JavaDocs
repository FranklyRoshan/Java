To generate Javadoc in Eclipse:

Write Javadoc comments in your code using /** ... */ above classes, methods, or fields.
Go to Project → Generate Javadoc.
Set the Javadoc command (e.g., javadoc.exe in your JDK’s bin folder).
Select the project/packages to document.
Choose visibility (Public, Protected, etc.).
Set the destination folder for output.
Add a document title and configure options (e.g., include @author, @version).
Click Finish.
The generated HTML docs will be in the destination folder — open index.html to view.
