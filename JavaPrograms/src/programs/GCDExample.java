 Question: Find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of Two Numbers

Problem Statement:
Write a Java program to find the GCD (also known as HCF â€“ Highest Common Factor) of two positive integers.


---

Example 1:

Input:

a = 36
b = 60

Output:

GCD: 12


---

Constraints:

Use a loop or Euclidean Algorithm (preferred).

Avoid using built-in functions like BigInteger.gcd() for now.
